## Daily routine

- Wake up ~7-8am
- Breakfast 8am. See 'Feeding' section
- Walk (1-2hrs) starting anytime between 8-10am.
- Return home, play if in the mood (tug) then lie down and sleep
- Dinner 6pm
- Walk between 8-10pm
- Sleeps at ~11pm inside crate.

## Medications

- Calming tablets (tryptophan based) with breakfast and dinner hidden in peanut butter or banana bit.

## Feeding

- Twice per day (8am and 6pm), "Essential Foods", 100g each time. All food is grain-free, without meat derivatives
- Feeding of meals is through hand feeding (giving him kibble piece by piece whilst stroking him and being affectionate) and part trick training. Important not to trick train too much as can stress out. We aim to do 3-5 minutes of trick training, starting and ending with an easy trick (e.g. sit, down, high five).
  - ALTERNATIVE 1: feed meal through Kong wobbler
  - ALTERNATIVE 2: feed meal through structured walk 
  - ALTERNATIVE 3: rarely give it for 'free' in a bowl, and is reserved if has had a particularly stressful day recently, or on occasion to give him a break. He will eat this meal within one minute if this method is used.
- **Treats** (NB: walk-specific treats must not be used in the home as treats):
  - Home - carrot cube chunks (too much causes diarrhoea), kibble, radishes, banana, peanut butter
  - On walks - kibble, higher value meat pate or cheese
- **Long lasting chews** - enjoys a selection of pigs ears, feet, lamb legs etc. He needs supervision whilst chewing in case he chokes (never happened before) and access to water afterwards. Can take 30-60 minutes to get through and will calm down. One per day as required.

## Toilet

- Usually goes twice per day and can last 12 hours comfortably without problem. Well toilet trained.
- In desperate scenarios (has happened when unwell once) will whine AND go to the door with scraping at the door

## Play

- Likes to tug with rope toy, and other sturdy items (e.g. mop head)
- Likes to chase plastic bags, balls, and other fast moving objects 
- Note may need to be 'activated' - two people encouragingly play with each other and invite him to join to get him involved.

## Sleep 

Sleeps most of the day and at night sleeps in the crate (shut), same hours as us.

## Capturing good behaviour

If noticed that he is lying down calmly --> random treat + "good settle"

## Challenges indoors

- Noise sensitive. 

  - Thunder and fireworks are the absolute worst thing for him and make him run around and bark. Very stressful for him, so far nothing has worked. May need light sedatives when predictable.
  - Sensitive to plane noises. Working on deconditioning. If hears plane  --> "good plane" --> looks at us & gets treat
  - Sometimes sensitive to other dogs barking outdoors but fairly rare. If hears dog, same as above.
- Postman
  - Doesn't like postman and sometimes whines --> once post is through the door, ask him to 'fetch the post', he does it for a treat. 

## Not allowed to:

- **Bark** more than 1-2 times without consequence. See troubleshooting.
- **Get on the window sill**. Used to look out and bark at dogs. 
- **Steal food.** If food dropped whilst preparing in kitchen, has been trained to look at you and only proceed to eating if you say: 'yes get it, good boy'

## Negative commands:

- A gentle 'no' to discourage a bad behaviour - **"uh-uh"**
- A firm 'no' if he does something seriously bad - **"NO."** in a sharp and assertive manner.
- **"Get off"** if somewhere he should not be.

## Troubleshooting:

| Behaviour                              | Likely cause + likely action to take                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Whine indoors at meal times (8am, 6pm) | Hungry, feed meal                                            |
| Sudden whine indoors                   | Has heard something outside that has unsettled him. Reassure. If persists place in crate, with kindness + not as punishment, food on entry to crate then regular food every 5 min (increasing to 15 min)  with 'good crate'. Let out once fully calm. Can sometimes sleep. |
| Whining AND  scraping at door          | Toilet                                                       |
| Barking                                | If more than twice, remove from trigger into neutral space (e.g. bathroom) with lifting. Calm down then let out. Never raise voice. |
